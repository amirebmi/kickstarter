## **Context**
This project is designed to predict whether a new project on Kickstarter will be successful based on its features.


## **Details:**
We are using a dataset that is from the year of 2018 which has 702,413 records of successful, failed, or canceled status.

-   The dataset contains 13 features and a label that indicate whether a project was successful, failed, or canceled depending on the features.
    

  

## **Features:**

-   **Name:** Indicates the name of a project.
    
-   **Category:** Indicates the type of a project. E.g. a game project.
    
-   **Main Category:** Indicates the details of a project. E.g. If a project is in the Restaurant category, Main Category can be stated as Bar or Food.
    
-   **Currency:** Indicates the currency that the project needs to be funded. E.g. USD, GBP, CAD, etc.
    
-   **Deadline:** Indicates when the deadline of a project is for funding and a chance for winning, failing, or getting canceled.
    
-   **Goal:** Indicates the amount of money that a project needs to acquire in order to win.
    
-   **Launched:** Indicates the date that a project started.
    
-   **Pledged:** Indicates the amount of money that has been funded to a project. If pledge is less than the goal, the chance of the failure of a project is significantly high.
    
-   **State:** Indicates of a project had a chance to win, fail, or even get canceled,
    
-   **Backers:** Indicates the number of people who funded a project.
    
-   **Country:** Indicates the name of the country that a project was launched.
    
-   **USD Pledged:** Indicates the amount of money that has been funded in the United States Dollar. Note: A project can be funded in another currency; however, this feature converts all currencies to USD.
    
-   **USD_Pledged_Real:** Indicates the amount of money that has been funded in the United States Dollar. Note: This feature only shows the pledge that has been funded ONLY in USD. It DOES NOT convert other currencies to USD.
    
-   **USD_Goal_Real:** Indicates the amount of money that a project is defined as goal ONLY in USD. It DOES NOT indicate the goal in any other currencies.


## **Goals:**

-   Find a model that gives the most accurate prediction of whether or not a project has a chance of being successful, using machine learning techniques we learn in data science and through online research.
